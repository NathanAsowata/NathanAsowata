### Hi, I'm Nathan,

Front End Developer with 2+ years of experience in building client-side applications with React, Typescript, and NextJS. Checkout my latest side project: A PWA called [Movies](https://movies.nathanasowata.com/) built using NextJS and TypeScript.

My current tech stack is mainly TypeScript, React, NextJS, Sass, and other tools in React's ecosystem. I'm currently focusing on improving my skills in server-side development.
